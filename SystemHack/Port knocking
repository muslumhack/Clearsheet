Knock

apt-get install knockd
Then you simply type: knock [ip] [port]. For example: knock 192.168.1.102 4000 5000 6000
After that you have to scan the network to see if any new port is open.
If you know what port is open you can connect to the port using netcat. The following command would work nc 192.168.1.102 8888. This would then connect to the port.
Nmap/bash

for x in 4000 5000 6000; do nmap -Pn --host_timeout 201 --max-retries 0 -p $x server_ip_address; done
Netcat
nc 192.168.1.102 4000
nc 192.168.1.102 5000
nc 192.168.1.102 6000
nc 192.168.1.102 8888
